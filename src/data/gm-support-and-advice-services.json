We start by setting up a care of address, so people can register for benefits and a simple bank account. We address the most urgent needs i.e. emergency shelter, accommodation, healthcare rehab, safety, training and jobs, making referrals as needed to other support agencies and Manchester City Council. Our support workers aim to create a level of trust and rapport with with our friends, helping them to rebuild their lives. We also visit inmates nearing release at HMP Manchester. We help to find housing solutions, offer mediation and advocacy support. After release we help with all aspects of rehabilitation to reduce the chances of re-offending and homelessness. ",

This is known as lacking capacity. The Mental Capacity Act says that people who are aged over 16 and who lack capacity to make certain decisions should have an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) appointed to represent them and protect their interests.&#10;&#10;An IMCA is an advocate who is qualified to work within the framework of the Mental Capacity Act.&#10;&#10;When can I get an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate?&#10;&#10;An advocate will be appointed where a person lacks capacity and has no family or friends who can be consulted about the decision. An advocate can be appointed when the decision involves;&#10;&#10;Serious medical treatment&#10;Change of accommodation&#10;Adult Safeguarding Procedures (even when there are family/ friends involved)&#10;Care Reviews&#10;Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards &ndash; DoLS (See guide below).&#10;&#10;What will an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate do?&#10;&#10;An advocate will meet and support the person to find out about their wishes, feelings and values. They will represent the person at meetings and challenge decisions if they do not appear to be in the person&rsquo;s best interest. An advocate will check that the principles of the Mental Capacity Act are being followed and that alternative options are being considered for the person. The advocate will write a report for the decision maker which must be taken into account when the decision is being made.",
